# Archipelago-Manual-Northgard
 Files required to run the Manual Archipelago for Northgard

## Goal
* Complete your Conquest map with the random Clan you were given
## How to play
* Select which DLCs you have in the YAML file
* You will receive 1 Random clan amongst those selected + Base Clans
* Each Chapters completed in your Conquest map gives you 4 items
* You can only complete the Chapters you have unlocked as items (outside of the first one, this one is free)
* You can use anything that's not mentioned in the following ``Items you can receive`` list
 * Once you receive one of those items, you can use it
## Chapters Explanation
In every Conquest, the maps will be unlocked the same way:
* You start with Chapter 1, the big left one
* When a big map is completed, you have access to 2 new maps, a top and bottom one. For example that would be Chapter 2
* When a small map is completed and not followed by a big map, you will again unlock 2 new maps, a top and bottom one. For example Chapter 3.
* Basically just remember that each "Chapter" comes in either a single 1 big map, or a group of 2 small maps. There will always be a top and bottom map in each Conquest map pairs.
