# Archipelago-Manual-Northgard
This manual is to be used with the game Northgard, using the Conquest mode.

## Goal
* Complete your Conquest map, either solo or in multiplayer.
## How to play
* Each Chapters completed in your Conquest map gives you an amount of items as defined in the YAML.
* You can only complete the Chapters you have unlocked as items (outside of the first one, this one is free)
## Chapters Explanation
In every Conquest, the maps will be unlocked the same way:
* You start with Chapter 1, the big left one
* When a big map is completed, you have access to 2 new maps, a top and bottom one. For example that would be Chapter 2
* When a small map is completed and not followed by a big map, you will again unlock 2 new maps, a top and bottom one. For example Chapter 3.
* Basically just remember that each "Chapter" comes in either a single 1 big map, or a group of 2 small maps. There will always be a top and bottom map in each Conquest map pairs.
